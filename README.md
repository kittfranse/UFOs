# UFOs
Javascript and Bootstrap (HTML) for a dynamic webpage and interactive dashboard.

##Overview

The main purpose of this exercise is to create a interactive dashboard to house an array of information.  Data from a JavaScript list of key-value pairs is used to display on a webpage. Then, the values are filtered so that a user can find information pertinent to their needs.  This combines functionality from JavaScript, Bootstrap (HTML), and CSS.

### How to use:

 Sadly, I cannot get my table to populate the information from the data.JS file. I've tried restructuring the HTML and abduct Jess multiple ways and it will not display the table data. So, in Lou of that, I have set up the shell for how everything should potentially work, but I have no way of knowing if my filters are actually working. But ideally what would happen is I would enter the information and it would scroll to the entries that match whatever is being typed into the filter.

## Drawbacks to Filter System

The place holders are useful to let the user know the syntax/format Of the entry. But since there's so much data, it is hard for a user to know exactly how to enter the information so that the filter will actually work properly. Since we have a limited amount of data, it would be better to use some form of a drop-down menu so that a user doesn't have to guess how to filter the data. The way this is set up provides a lot of room for returning empty tables.
